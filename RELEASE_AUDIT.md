# Release audit

Release: **v1.0.0**  
Audit date: **2026-10-01**

## Release gate

The public GitHub Actions workflow runs on Python **3.10, 3.11, and 3.12** and requires all of the following:

- package installation from the repository metadata;
- the complete pytest suite;
- Ruff static/lint checks;
- bytecode compilation of `src` and `tests`.

## Integration coverage

Synthetic AnnData CLI integration covers healthy 3D geometry, line collapse, and missing coordinates.

All repository fixtures are synthetic or generated during tests. No restricted or withheld Virtual Embryo Challenge data is bundled.

## Source contract

Challenge-specific statements are tied to `docs/SOURCES.md`. The official Virtual Embryo Challenge website and public scorer remain authoritative if the competition changes after the snapshot date.

## Release standard

A release is considered green only when the complete GitHub Actions matrix succeeds. README examples, package entry points, tests, license, contribution text, and source snapshot are included in the repository.
